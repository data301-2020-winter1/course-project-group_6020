# Our Question
Through the group project, we are hoping to acquire more in-depth knowledge regarding data analytics and advance our technical skillset. In today’s contemporary world, reducing carbon footprint and living environmentally-friendly is absolutely crucial, thus; our group decided to use data on bike sharing to do our data analysis project. Using data on bike sharing, we will further explore the correlation between people’s decision to rent a bike and weather condition, precisely wind speed and humidity. Our data analysis will aim to answer this question: “Is there any correlation between renting a bike and weather condition (humidity & wind speed), if so what is considered as a best weather and worst weather to rent a bike?”. We aspire that bike-sharing companies will be able to construct and develop a marketing strategy with our data analysis; therefore, encourage communities and individuals to choose eco-friendly and healthy options such as cycling. We can imagine building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset in the final weeks of this course.

From the graph, we can see that users follow the usual pattern: they bike in good weather the most and normal weather. There is a small amount of users who bike in lightly bad weather, which we can infer that they only have bike as the travel means or their car broke and they have to use the bike as temporary means. One more thing to consider is that no one bikes in severe weather - which is quite obvious

The graph demonstrates that people bike the most in fall and summer, which is quite obvious. However, there is a significant amount of users in Winter (double than in Spring and close to Summer), which is weird because usually Winter is colder than Spring and snowing will affect biking a lot.

According to the graph, there is not much difference between the weekday, including weekend. It is expected that there will be more users in the weekend than weekdays because people will have more free time. However Sunday has the least users among seven days. This reflects that people spends more time indoors when they have free time, and bikes are most used to do work, not entertain

From the graph, we notice that from windspeed 0.08 and 0.25, it has most peaks. Therefore we can conclude that it is the ideal wind speed that users intend to travel. Started from 0.3, the peaks start decreasing and there is a significant drop from 0.4 to 0.5
