# Our Question
Through the group project, we are hoping to acquire more in-depth knowledge regarding data analytics and advance our technical skillset. In today’s contemporary world, reducing carbon footprint and living environmentally-friendly is absolutely crucial, thus; our group decided to use data on bike sharing to do our data analysis project. Using data on bike sharing, we will further explore the correlation between people’s decision to rent a bike and weather condition, precisely wind speed and humidity. Our data analysis will aim to answer this question: “Is there any correlation between renting a bike and weather condition (humidity & wind speed), if so what is considered as a best weather and worst weather to rent a bike?”. We aspire that bike-sharing companies will be able to construct and develop a marketing strategy with our data analysis; therefore, encourage communities and individuals to choose eco-friendly and healthy options such as cycling. We can imagine building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset in the final weeks of this course.

## Observation on the 1st graph:

*-This graph shows that higher the temprature, more casual users appear, however, temperature betweem 0.4-0.8 there are number of more casual users are appearing*
*-Between 0-1000 almost equal amount of destribution among different temperatures*

## Observation from graph 2 (Registered users & Temperature)

>*Similar to graph one however we can see Registered users tend to use the bike sharing despite the weather and there are more users appearing densely when temperature is between 0.4-0.8*

## Observation from Graph 3 
*-This graph shows the correlation between wind speed and registered users with the factors of seasons*
*-Spring less than 5000 registered users*
*-When windspeed is high, not many resigtered users rented a bike especially in fall and winter. Surprisingly in the spring, registered user's tendency to rent a bike during high windspeed weather is high.*

## Observation from Graph 4 (Heat Graph)
*-This graph shows all the possible correlation between all columns*
