# Our Question
In today’s contemporary world, reducing carbon footprint and living environmentally-friendly is absolutely crucial, thus; our group decided to use data on bike sharing to do our data analysis project. Using data on bike sharing, we will further explore the correlation between people’s decision to rent a bike and weather conditions. Conditions such as the season, humidity, windpseed, etc. Our data analysis will aim to answer this question: **“Is there any correlation between renting a bike and weather condition (humidity, wind speed, etc.), if so what is considered as a best weather and worst weather to rent a bike?”.** We aspire that bike-sharing companies will be able to construct and develop a marketing strategy with our data analysis; therefore, encouraging communities and individuals to choose eco-friendly and healthy options such as cycling.

### Info
Through these four graphs all four season are covered and at a glance a user can assume which season has the most days where bikes are being rented. 
They can assume this not just based on the registered users but casual users as well. Then from there you can see which days have the highest number of renters as well as what day of the week that data is taken from. Then finally you can see how weather affects rentals throughout each season. 
* **Spring:** Spring surprised me with how low the numbers were. Sundays at a glance seemed particularly popular, not many people rented on good weather days but it seems people rented consistently regardless.
* **Summer:** Summer seems to have had the second most users at a glance and perhaps it is just because the summer has more "normal" days that would be deemed good in other seasons but out of all the seasons it seems summer has the most users on "normal" days.
* **Fall:** Fall surprisingly seems to have the most users consistently on "good" days.
* **Winter:** Winter has a surprisingly high amount of users in general, as well as the most users on "bad" days which is interesting.

From the graph, we can see that users follow the usual pattern: they bike in good weather the most and normal weather. There is a small amount of users who bike in lightly bad weather, which we can infer that they only have bike as the travel means or their car broke and they have to use the bike as temporary means. One more thing to consider is that no one bikes in severe weather - which is quite obvious

The graph demonstrates that people bike the most in fall and summer, which is quite obvious. However, there is a significant amount of users in Winter (double than in Spring and close to Summer), which is weird because usually Winter is colder than Spring and snowing will affect biking a lot.

According to the graph, there is not much difference between the weekday, including weekend. It is expected that there will be more users in the weekend than weekdays because people will have more free time. However Sunday has the least users among seven days. This reflects that people spends more time indoors when they have free time, and bikes are most used to do work, not entertain

From the graph, we notice that from windspeed 0.08 and 0.25, it has most peaks. Therefore we can conclude that it is the ideal wind speed that users intend to travel. Started from 0.3, the peaks start decreasing and there is a significant drop from 0.4 to 0.5

## Observation on the 1st graph:
>This graph shows the correlation between wind speed and registered users with the factors of seasons*
>Spring less than 5000 registered users
>When windspeed is high, not many resigtered users rented a bike especially in fall and winter. Surprisingly in the spring, registered user's tendency to rent a bike during high windspeed weather is high
>This graph shows that higher the temprature, more casual users appear, however, temperature betweem 0.4-0.8 there are number of more casual users are appearing*
>Between 0-1000 almost equal amount of destribution among different temperatures*

## Observation from graph 2 (Registered users & Temperature)
>Similar to graph one however we can see Registered users tend to use the bike sharing despite the weather and there are more users appearing densely when temperature is between 0.4-0.8*

## Observation from Graph 3 
>This graph shows that higher the temprature, more casual users appear, however, temperature betweem 0.4-0.8 there are number of more casual users are appearing*
>Between 0-1000 almost equal amount of destribution among different temperatures*
